=====

A DIY Arduino-powered clone of Mutable Instruments [Branches][5], with a couple additional features.

Features
--------

- Two Bernoulli gates similar to the ones found in Mutable Instruments [Branches][5]:
    - the **input** signal (trigger or gate) is routed to either of two outputs;
	- the **knob** and **CV input** control the probability of routing the signal to either outputs.
- Manual input button, it can be used as a manual trigger/gate generator.
- Both toggle and latch modes are enabled with two independent dedicated switches:
    - in **toggle** mode, probability is used to decide if sending the signal to the same output as before, or the other;
    - in **latch** mode, an output stays high until the other output gets activated.
- The second channel input is optionally normalized to the first one, using a jumper on the back.

Schematic
---------

Only one Bernoulli gate is laid out, the second is an exact copy.
